    \begin{abstract}
        In this paper we proposed an algorithm for smooth trajectory generation in complex environments with dynamic obstacles and velocity constraints. The proposed algorithm Tube Space-Time RRT* (Tube ST-RRT*) is combined with the improved reformulation dynamic coordinate minimum snap (RDCMS) to generate smooth collision-free trajectories with asymptotic time Optimal.First, sample the space-time state space to obtain the time information for each node to complete the avoidance of moving obstacles.Then, to address the issue of non-smooth paths in ST-RRT*, generate a dynamic Tube for each node and combine it with the improved minisnap to create a smooth, collision-free trajectory Finally,Simulations in complex environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

    \section{Introduction}
        Trajectory planning is a fundamental challenge in robotics\cite{b1}, as obstacles in the real world often change over time. Applications such as robotics and autonomous driving typically require a smooth, collision-free trajectory. Assuming the obstacle trajectories are known a priori, the problem can be modeled as navigation in a dynamic environment. Mathematically, this is expressed as planning through a space-time state space \cite{b2}.

        Planning in dynamic environments has been studied for a long time and has yielded significant research results. These results can be broadly categorized into two approaches. For example, RRTX\cite{b3} and Real-time RRT* \cite{b4} require fast replanning when previously computed paths become invalid during execution. However, as the dimensionality increases, the replanning time becomes longer, making it difficult to respond to moving obstacles. RiskRRT \cite{b5} combines predictions of obstacle movements and computes partial motion paths to keep the collision probability below a given threshold. However, since only partial paths are returned, frequent replanning is still necessary.Another approach assumes that the trajectories of moving obstacles are unknown, while another assumes that the trajectories of the obstacles are completely known. For example, Time-Based RRT \cite{b6} extends the configuration state space through the time dimension and unidirectionally plans to a set of known target states. However, it requires the assumption of knowing the specific time for each target configuration. Additionally, due to the random sampling nature of RRT, the resulting trajectories are usually not smooth.

        In this paper, we proposes a Tube-based space-time sampling planning algorithm, Tube-ST-RRT*, and an improved reformulation dynamic coordinate minimum snap (RDCMS) method. Through a two-step method of  planning and optimizing, it achieves asymptotic time-optimal collision-free trajectory planning in dynamic environments, while ensuring high trajectory smoothness to facilitate easier tracking control. The Tube-ST-RRT* algorithm adds a time dimension to the configuration space so that each node contains time information, allowing it to respond to time-varying obstacles. Additionally, the improved RDCMS method combines with each node's tube information and time information to generate smooth, collision-free trajectories. Finally, comparative simulations verify the effectiveness of the algorithm

        The rest of this paper is organized as follows: At Section II, explains the problem of time-optimal planning in dynamic environments. In Section III,presents the main results of this paper, including the principles and steps of the Tube ST-RRT* planning algorithm and the RDCMS trajectory optimization algorithm. Section IV provides simulation results and comparative experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method. Finally, Section V summarizes the paper.
    \section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
    Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
    separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
    formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA} to \ref{FAT} below for more information on 
    proofreading, spelling and grammar.

    Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
    formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
    for you.

    \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
    Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
    even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
    IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
    abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

    \subsection{Units}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
    \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
    \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
    \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Equations}
    Number equations consecutively. To make your 
    equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
    appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
    but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
    sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
    sentence, as in:
    \begin{equation}
    a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
    \end{equation}

    Be sure that the 
    symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
    the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
    the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

    \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

    Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
    of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
    to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
    citations without having to go through the file line by line.

    Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
    \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
    environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

    Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
    will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
    equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
    article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
    the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
    counting.

    {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
    data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
    bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

    {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
    subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
    referenced as Table IV-B3. 

    {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
    \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
    supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
    cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
    should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

    Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
    will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
    any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
    surrounding equation.

    \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
    \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
    \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
    \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
    \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
    \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
    \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
    \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
    \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
    \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
    \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
    \end{itemize}
    An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

    \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}\label{AAA}
    \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
    minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
    should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
    next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
    and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
    affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
    example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

    \subsection{Identify the Headings}\label{ITH}
    Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
    your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

    Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
    topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
    References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
    ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
    table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
    style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
    down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

    Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
    example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
    material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
    sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
    and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
    should be introduced.

    \subsection{Figures and Tables}\label{FAT}
    \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
    bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
    figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
    below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
    figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
    ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

    \begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Table Type Styles}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
    \cline{2-4} 
    \textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
    \hline
    copy& More table copy$^{\mathrm{a}}$& &  \\
    \hline
    \multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab1}
    \end{center}
    \end{table}

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
    \caption{Example of a figure caption.}
    \label{fig}
    \end{figure}

    Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
    rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
    avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
    ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
    units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
    with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
    \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
    quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
    ``Temperature/K''.

    \section*{Acknowledgment}

    The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
    an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
    G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
    acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

    \section*{References}

    Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
    sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
    number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
    the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

    Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
    the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
    abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

    Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
    ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
    submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
    that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
    Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
    element symbols.

    For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
    citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
